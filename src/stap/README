SystemTap script for RDS

SystemTap wiki: http://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki

To use SystemTap for tracing RDS, please ensure you
have debugging symbols available for both your installed kernel
as well as RDS module. These usually take the form of 
*-debuginfo RPMs, and may be available via your distro's
update repository, a distro repository disabled by
default, or via your distro's website.

Please send any comments or improvement patches to
rds-devel@oss.oracle.com.
