So, rds-get-stats is easy and I already have it done.  we'd just import
that.

rds-gen would just send down a socket.  I'm hoping for options like:

 -s addr:port
	to bind the source address
 -d addr:port
	dest to send to, maybe just round-robin between multiple to
	start?
 -m units
	the size of each sent message
 -b units
	the size of the socket buffer
 -5
	include an md5sum at the tail of each message
 -f file
	read from a file until eof
 -p units
	send from a memory pool of the given length
 -S file
	put the -p pool in this mmaped/mlocked file, use sendfile
 -l units
	only send this many bytes total
 -i timespec
	output vmstat-like line at this interval

I guess that gives us enough to chew on for now :)  I want this stuff to
be dirt simple.  trivial arg parser helpers, maybe some list.h from the
kernel, no glib complexity explosion.  I guess I could send you some
snippets of code along those lines.

Oh, and I guess we'll need a little helper amongst the tools to get
pf_rds and sol_rds from /proc/sys/net/rds/.
